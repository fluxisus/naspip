# NASPIP: Network-Agnostic Secure Payment Instruction Protocol

## What is NASPIP?

**NASPIP (Network-Agnostic Secure Payment Instruction Protocol)** is a standard for securely transmitting 
payment instructions regardless of the payment network you want to use.


**NASPIP** defines the data structure to be transmitted, allowing for typical open or closed payment flows, static and dynamic QR codes, expiration, etc. 

It even allows the payers to choose the network and token from various options.


## Motivation

In payment systems, there is a transfer of the information necessary to make the payment from the collector 
to the payer or vice versa.

The different payment methods have developed different solutions to this problem thinking about 
the best experience for users. For example, credit and debit cards have been changing this solution over time, 
facilitating the interaction between the payer and the collector.

For cryptocurrency payments, in particular, this is currently a challenge. The existence of several blockchains
and tokens, and the type of information that the user needs to handle to make a payment, make it complex for 
users who do not have knowledge of blockchain or cryptocurrencies in general.

**NASPIP** is the solution that allows to improve the user experience to the level of other traditional payment methods.

## Introduction

Payment systems need to transfer information between the payer and the collector. There are 
some interesting cases that I want to highlight.

- **Lightning Network**
LN invoices are very practical to present in a QR code and can be generated dynamically with an expiration for both open and closed amounts. In turn, the [LNURL](https://github.com/lnurl/luds) protocol allows generating static QR codes with a public encoding of a URL. It is a very simple and easy to implement, the only disadvantage is that there is no validation or verification of the data encoding.

- **PIX Brazil** 
A centralized interoperable solution from the [Central Bank of Brazil (BCB)](https://www.bcb.gov.br/en/financialstability/pix_en). It is a very good solution for payments with the Brazilian banking system.
</br>
- **QR Interoperable Argentina** 
A centralized interoperable solution from the [Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA)](https://www.bcra.gob.ar/), very similar to the PIX Brazil solution. It uses the [EMV&reg; QR](https://www.emvco.com/) standard and the data validation is carried out by the parties that interact in the payment process.

For cryptocurrency payment systems we propose this [protocol](./docs/Implementation.md) that has the following rfeatures:

- **Secure:** NASPIP implements an asymmetric encryption scheme, so that the payer could verify/validate the information generated by the collector.
- **Agnostic:** Could be used for any network and currency/token.
- **Interoperable:** Anyone can implement the protocol for read and write.
- **Easy to implement:** The implementation to read/write the NASPIP Tokens is totally individual to who wants to use it.
- **Flexible:** Supports typical open/closed amount payment flows and dynamic/static payment data.
