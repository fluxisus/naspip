# NASPIP Security

NASPIP Tokens use asymmetric encryptation (private/public key) as a security method.

For this purpose, [PASETO Version 4](https://github.com/paseto-standard/paseto-spec/blob/master/README.md) is implemented, which allows the information to be signed with a **private key** and then to be able to verify said signature with the **public key**.

## PASETO Format
The PASETO V4 token has the following format:

`v4.public.{payload}.{footer}`

Where `footer` is optional, and the format without `footer` is `v4.public.{payload}`.

The decoded `payload` has the following data structure:

| Key       | Name            | Data Type       | Description | Example|
|:----------|:----------------|:----------------|:-------------|:--------|
| iss       |  Issuer         | string (reserved, required) | -| paragonie.com|
| sub       |  Subject        | string (reserved)    |- |test@test.com|
| aud       |  Audience       | string (reserved)    |-|some-ecommerce.com|
| exp       |  Expiration     | DtTime (reserved, required)    |-|2039-01-01T00:00:00Z|
| nbf       |  Not Before     | DtTime (reserved)    |-|2039-01-01T00:00:00Z|
| iat       |  Issued At      | DtTime (reserved, required)    |-|2039-01-01T00:00:00Z|
| jti       |  Token ID       | string (reserved)    |-|87IFSGFgPNtQNNuw0AtuLttP|
| kid       |  Key ID         | string (reserved, required)    |Public key identifying ID|some-custom-id|
| kep       |  Key Expiration | DtTime (reserved, required)    |Public key expiration|2039-01-01T00:00:00Z|
| kis       |  Key Issuer     | string (reserved, required)    |Public key issuer|com.payer|
| payload   |  Data           | Object (required)    | -||

All the standard claims of PASETO could be found in this [link](https://github.com/paseto-standard/paseto-spec/blob/master/README.md). The custom claims `kid`, `kep`, and `kis` was added for this protocol, and they are explained in below.

The `iss`, `sub` and `aud` claims can be used to identify who requested the token creation.

The `payload` claim is explained in [Data Structure Section](./3.Data%20Structure.md)

## Key Management

There are two variables available to manage public/private keys, `kis` (Key Issuer) and `kid` (Key Id), also the `kep` (Key Expiration) is to rotate the keys.

The `kis` claim is used to identify the owner of the private key, and the `kid` claim is a custom ID of the owner of that private key.

The `kid` and `kis` must be between 5 - 20 characters long.

These claims allow managing the rotation of public/private key pairs and the management of public keys to verify the issued tokens. For example, by building the following map:

```json
{
    "[kis]": {
        "[kid1]": {
            "publicKey": "first-public-key",
            "kep": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
        },
        "[kid2]": {
            "publicKey": "second-public-key",
            "kep": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"
        }
    }
}

```

The public/private keys could be in a [paserk format](https://github.com/paseto-standard/paserk).

## Implemetation Details

PASETO V4 has a feature called implicit assertions that is used in the signature calculation, but is **NOT** stored in the token.

NASPIP uses this feature as an extra security measure. The corresponding public key is used as the implicit assertion. Therefore, in the creation and verification of the NASPIP tokens, the public key must be used as the implicit assertion.
