## NASPIP Token Format

The NASPIP token format is:

```
qr-payment;{kis};{kid};{PASETO V4 Token}
```

In [Security Section](./2.Security.md) is described the `kis`, `kid` and `PASETO V4 Token`.

As you can see, the NASPIP token contains the `kis` and `kid` needed to map the public key (see [Security Section](./2.Security.md)) and verify the PASETO V4 Token to get the information.
