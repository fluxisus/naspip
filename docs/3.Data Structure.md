# Data Structure

NASPIP is designed to share contextual information about a payment to provide a better user experience and support typical payment flows:
- Open/Closed Amount
- Dynamic/Static QR

Additionally, taking into account the large number of payment options that exist between the network and the token (especially in cryptocurrency payments), the data structure was designed to manage these options.

Two data structures are defined for the claim `payload` (from PASETO v4 Token, see [Security Section](./2.Security.md)), which we will call **Payment Instructions** and **URL Payload**.

Examples of the use of these data structures are provided in the [Use Cases Section](./4.Use%20Cases.md).

## Payment Instruction

The data structure is:

```ts
interface PaymentInstruction {
    "payment": {
        "id": string;
        "amount"?: string; // required is is_open = false
        "address": string;
        "address_tag"?: string;
        "network_token": string; // The Unique Asset ID
        "is_open": boolean;
        "min_amount"?: string; // required when is_open = true
        "max_amount"?: string; // required when is_open = true
        "expires_at": number; // required unix timestamp in miliseconds
    };
	
    "order"?: OrderData
}

interface OrderData {
	"total_amount"?: string;
	"coin_code"?: string;
	"description"?: string;
	"merchant"?: {
        "name": string;
        "description"?: string;
        "tax_id"?: string;
        "image"?: string; // url, data-uri scheme i.e. data:image/[type];base64,[base_64_encoded_file_contents]
        "mcc"?: string; // merchant category code. ISO 18245
    };
	"items"?: {
			"description": string;
			"amount": string;
			"coin_code": string;
			"unit_price"?: string;
			"quantity"?: string;
		}[]
}
```

The **Payment Instruction** is divided into two data groups, `payment` and `order`.

The `payment` key contains the information needed to make the payment, highlighting that the [Unique Asset ID](./Unique%20Asset%20ID.md) is used for the token and the network (`network_token` key). The `expires_at` key must be in Unix time in milliseconds and must be consistent with the PASETO token expiration.

The `order` key contains contextual information about what is being paid, such as merchant data, order items, the total amount and a description. The `coin_code` key is **NOT** a Unique Asset ID, it's used to identifies the currency, for example USDT, BTC, ARS, EUR, etc.


## URL Payload

The data structure is:

```ts
interface URLPayload {
    "url": string;
    "payment_options"?: string[] // Array of Unique Asset ID 
    "order"?: OrderData
}
```

The `url` must be and endpoint that allow `GET` request and response the `PaymentInstruction` or `URLPayload` with `payment_options`, for example:

```
GET https://my-ecommerce.com/checkout?id=156fa662-cfee-443a-9a00-9fe9ae9c75aa
```

The `payment_options` key is optional and contains the different payment options available. If it exists, it must be added to the GET request as a query param `payment_option`, for example:

```
GET https://my-ecommerce.com/card?id=bfa8b19b-786c-4046-8e87-de31dc9735f8&payment_option=nbep20_t0x8AC76a51cc950d9822D68b83fE1Ad97B32Cd580d
```

Finally, the `order` key is also optional and is intended to be able to provide contextual information when there are several `payment_options`.
